      <p>
        To make use of the NEAR blockchain, you need to sign in. The button
        below will sign you in using NEAR Wallet.
      </p>
      <p>
        By default, when your app runs in "development" mode, it connects
        to a test network ("testnet") wallet. This works just like the main
        network ("mainnet") wallet, but the NEAR Tokens on testnet aren't
        convertible to other currencies â€“ they're just for testing!

        <button onClick={login}>Sign in</button>
